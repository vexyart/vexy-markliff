## TASK

The @docs folder is our working location for our spec documents.

Read:

@docs/500-intro.md
@docs/502-htmlattr.md
@docs/510-prefs-html0.md
@docs/511-prefs-html1.md
@docs/512-prefs-html2.md
@docs/513-prefs-md.md
@docs/520-var.md
@docs/530-vexy-markliff-spec.md

Consult the @external/901-xliff-spec-core-21.xml spec.

Then read @docs/530-vexy-markliff-spec.md

Into @PLAN.md write a detailed plan for the development of Vexy Markliff, a Python package and Fire CLI tool that handles bidirectional Markdown/HTML <-> XLIFF conversion.

The conversion should allow several modes regarding source and target:

1. One-document mode:

- Store the content in the `<source>`
- Store the content in the `<target>`
- Store the content in both `<source>` and `<target>`

2. Two-document mode:

This needs some advanced parallelization to handle the case where we have two documents, one in source language and one in target language.

- Store the content of the 1st document in the `<source>`
- Store the content of the 2nd document in the `<target>`

Once youâ€™ve written the /plan, write a flat detailed list into @TODO.md
