## TASK

The @docs folder is our working location for our spec documents.

Read:

@docs/500-intro.md
@docs/502-htmlattr.md
@docs/510-prefs-html0.md
@docs/511-prefs-html1.md
@docs/512-prefs-html2.md
@docs/520-var.md

Adjust @docs/510-prefs-html0.md @docs/511-prefs-html1.md @docs/512-prefs-html2.md so that we have a clear and consistent and complete spec for handling all HTML5 tags in XLIFF, using the preferences and decision guides that are already established in that document.

Adjust @docs/513-prefs-md.md so we have a comparable spec for expressing Markdown in XLIFF.

The idea is that we heavily utilize the HTML handling of XLIFF to handle Markdown. We compile Markdown to HTML and then use the HTML handling of XLIFF to express the Markdown in XLIFF. We treat the remaining Markdown dumbly, as if it were text.

When it doubt, consult the @external/901-xliff-spec-core-21.xml spec.

Then adjust @docs/530-vexy-markliff-spec.md so we have a detailed spec for Vexy Markliff, a Python package and Fire CLI tool that handles bidirectional Markdown/HTML <-> XLIFF conversion.

The conversion should allow several modes regarding source and target:

1. One-document mode:

- Store the content in the `<source>`
- Store the content in the `<target>`
- Store the content in both `<source>` and `<target>`

2. Two-document mode:

This needs some advanced parallelization to handle the case where we have two documents, one in source language and one in target language.

- Store the content of the 1st document in the `<source>`
- Store the content of the 2nd document in the `<target>`
