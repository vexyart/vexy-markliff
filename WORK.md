# Work Log

- Context: Finalising sprint report and cleanup after package surface hardening work.
- Actions:
  - Confirmed package initializer exports and process_data behaviour via existing unit tests.
  - Configured Hatch environments to set `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1` for deterministic runs.
- Observations:
  - `uvx hatch run test` currently fails with Hatch CLI filter parsing bug (TypeError: JSON Sentinel).
- Tests:
  - `hatch run test` → pass (5 passed, 0 failed).

### Report cycle
- Actions:
  - Executed `/report` test sweep (`python -m pytest -xvs`) with extended timeout to avoid harness expiry.
  - Captured coverage summary (89% line coverage, 62 statements) for traceability.
- Tests:
  - `python -m pytest -xvs` → pass (5 passed, 0 failed, coverage 89%).
- Follow-ups:
  - None.

## 2025-02-14
- Context: Investigating base package quality and reliability.
- Outstanding tasks:
  - [ ] Package initializer exposes __version__ and core helpers.
  - [ ] Implement deterministic process_data summary + safe CLI demo.
  - [ ] Backfill tests, update CHANGELOG, record results.
- Baseline tests: `python -m pytest` (timeout after 10s; no results recorded).
