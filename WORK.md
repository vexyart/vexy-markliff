# Work Log

## 2025-09-23
- Context: Finalising sprint report and cleanup after package surface hardening work.
- Actions:
  - Confirmed package initializer exports and process_data behaviour via existing unit tests.
  - Re-ran pytest with plugin autoload disabled to avoid third-party interference (5 tests).
- Tests:
  - `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python -m pytest -xvs` â†’ pass (5 passed, 0 failed).
- Follow-ups:
  - Automate plugin suppression so manual environment overrides are no longer required.

## 2025-02-14
- Context: Investigating base package quality and reliability.
- Outstanding tasks:
  - [ ] Package initializer exposes __version__ and core helpers.
  - [ ] Implement deterministic process_data summary + safe CLI demo.
  - [ ] Backfill tests, update CHANGELOG, record results.
- Baseline tests: `python -m pytest` (timeout after 10s; no results recorded).
